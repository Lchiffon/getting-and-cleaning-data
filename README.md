the assessment of the Coursera: getting and cleaning data

the script works as follows:
Firstly, it merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.the name of this set is "data"

The set "data" only extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

At last, the script creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
